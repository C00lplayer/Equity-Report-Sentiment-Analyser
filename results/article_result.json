      "text": "Oil has come under pressure this year due to increased OPEC+ production and concerns around economic growth amidst escalating trade tensions. New supply from unwinding production cuts is a clear negative for the oil price, as the global market is in a small surplus. Easing Middle East conflict has driven a decline in the ‘geopolitical risk premium.’ The threat of US tariffs has fuelled concerns that an escalating trade war could meaningfully weigh on global economic activity/energy demand over the medium-term. Ongoing weakness in China’s economy presents headwinds to global oil demand. The energy sector has underperformed this year-to-date. Risks to the oil price are now balanced over the near-term. Macro fears are currently weighing on sentiment; we see scope for the oil price to stabilise around US$70/bbl. Trump’s policy tailwinds are incrementally positive for US producers but aren't expected to 'move the needle.' These policies have arguably de-risked US oil/gas projects, including Santos’ Pikka. Our long-term view towards oil remains positive. We expect oil demand to grow until 2050. US shale production is expected to plateau, supporting a relatively ‘balanced’ market, and is supportive of a long-term oil price of US$70-90/bbl. The Focus Portfolio remains modestly overweight the oil/gas sector, solely in Santos (STO). Santos is the standout exposure given its attractive (de-risked) production growth outlook, superior free cash flow profile, and disciplined capital allocation (driving improving shareholder returns). Santos’ Barossa (Q3 2025 first gas) and Pikka (mid-2026 first oil) growth projects are largely de-risked. This underpins a consensus production CAGR of 7% over 2024-2027. Santos is on the brink of a significant step change in free cash flows from late 2025. Management expects to drive $100-150m in annual structural cost savings.",

      "text": "Management’s new capital management framework will strengthen shareholder returns; Santos will return at least 60% of all-in free cash flows from 2026 (vs 40% previously). Trump administration tailwinds have improved the likelihood of a Pikka selldown. A complete sale is unlikely as it's a high quality asset that will deliver strong cash flows. A partial selldown could liberate US$1.15bn cash for capital returns (e.g., special dividends/buybacks), possibly by FY26/7. Pikka phase 1 is forecast to generate an IRR of ‘20% or higher.’",
